    "\n",
    "The Translator Use Case Question #5 is:    \n",
    "\n",
    "> If a patient with disease X is treated off-label with drug Y, what are some potential side effects?\n",
    "\n",
    "We interpret the Translator Use Case Question to be about **unintended drug-disease interactions**. These occur when a drug has an unintended effect on a person due to the personâ€™s existing medical conditions. \n",
    "* The interaction could be beneficial: for example, a person taking [lorazepam](https://www.drugs.com/ppa/lorazepam.html) for nighttime anxiety may also experience drowsiness (a common side effect), which may help them with their insomnia. \n",
    "* On the other hand, the interaction could be harmful: for example, a person with peptic ulcers may want to take [ibuprofen](https://www.drugs.com/ppa/ibuprofen.html) for a headache. However, NSAIDS can increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal inflammation, ulceration, bleeding, and perforation, especially for people with a history of GI ulcers or current GI ulcers. Some adverse drug-disease interactions, like the example here, are described in formal drug warnings and contraindications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that unintended drug-disease interactions occur in more contexts than off-label drug use. They can also occur when the drug is used following its label-indication and in [the context of comorbidity / multimorbidity](https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h949), when a person is taking a drug to treat one of their diseases and the drug affects a comorbid condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We therefore decided to reframe this question and find potential unintended drug-disease interactions with the following type of question:**\n",
    "> What symptoms do `Disease` X and `ChemicalSubstance` Y have in common? \n",
    "\n",
    "BioThings Explorer (BTE) can answer two classes of queries -- \"EXPLAIN\" and \"PREDICT\". This Question fits the EXPLAIN  template of starting with **a specific biomedical entity** (a specific `Disease` X) and finding indirect relationships with **another specific biomedical entity** (a specific `ChemicalSubstance` Y)."

    "We will use **hypertension** as our specific disease of interest. We will use **Cymbalta** as our drug of interest. This use case is an example of comorbidity and unintended drug-disease interactions. Many people have both hypertension and a [disease that can be treated with Cymbalta](https://www.drugs.com/ppa/duloxetine.html) (references: [hypertension and psychiatric disease, including depression and anxiety](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3996437/), [hypertension and fibromyalgia](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4575027/)). \n",

This adverse effect is described in [Cymbalta's warnings](https://www.drugs.com/ppa/duloxetine.html), along with advice to use Cymbalta with caution in patients with hypertension, monitor patients' blood pressure periodically while they take Cymbalta, and reduce or discontinue its use if patients experience sustained higher blood pressure from its use. \n",
    "\n",
    "We tackle the search for side-effects associated with using Cymbalta and having hypertension using the query:  \n",
    "* `PhenotypicFeature` hypertension  &rarr; results:`Disease` &larr; `ChemicalSubstance` Cymbalta. \n",
    "    * Note that we use the `PhenotypicFeature` entity for hypertension and `Disease` as the intermediate node type to represent disease symptoms and drug effects. With the current APIs available and issues around BioThings type annotation (PhenotypicFeatures vs Diseases), it made more sense to use these types for these nodes.  \n",
    "* The query will return a graph object with entities as nodes and relationships as edges. We then use edge provenance information to **filter** the results. For each intermediate Disease node, we use the number of unique paths from the input nodes to that node to **score** it. The scores can then be used to sort the results.    "

    "2. Surprisingly, BTE identifies another potential adverse side effect: [neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Disorders/All-Disorders/Neuroleptic-Malignant-Syndrome-Information-Page). NMS symptoms can include unstable blood pressure (this is the likely connection to high blood pressure). At first glance, it is surprising to link this syndrome with Cymbalta because this syndrome is rare and normally associated with neuroleptic or antipsychotic drugs (Cymbalta is neither of those). However, a search revealed that this association may be valid.\n",
    "    * [Serotonergic agents like Cymbalta may enhance adverse effects and the dopamine blockade of antipsychotic agents, so a person taking both classes of drugs may be at increased risk for neuroleptic malignant syndrome ](https://www.drugs.com/ppa/duloxetine.html)\n",
    "    * Related to the point above, [a case report linked sudden duloxetine *withdrawal* and antipsychotic medication treatment with neuroleptic malignant syndrome](https://n.neurology.org/content/88/16_Supplement/P2.219).\n",
    "    * [A few case reports have linked venlafaxine use (another drug in the SNRI class, like duloxetine) with neuroleptic malignant syndrome](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=neuroleptic+malignant+syndrome+venlafaxine)\n",
