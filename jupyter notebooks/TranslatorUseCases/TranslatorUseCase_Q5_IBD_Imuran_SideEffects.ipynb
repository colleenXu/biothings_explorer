    "\n",
    "The Translator Use Case Question #5 is:    \n",
    "\n",
    "> If a patient with disease X is treated off-label with drug Y, what are some potential side effects?\n",
    "\n",
    "We interpret the Translator Use Case Question to be about **unintended drug-disease interactions**. These occur when a drug has an unintended effect on a person due to the personâ€™s existing medical conditions. \n",
    "* The interaction could be beneficial: for example, a person taking [lorazepam](https://www.drugs.com/ppa/lorazepam.html) for nighttime anxiety may also experience drowsiness (a common side effect), which may help them with their insomnia. \n",
    "* On the other hand, the interaction could be harmful: for example, a person with peptic ulcers may want to take [ibuprofen](https://www.drugs.com/ppa/ibuprofen.html) for a headache. However, NSAIDS can increase the risk of serious gastrointestinal inflammation, ulceration, bleeding, and perforation, especially for people with a history of GI ulcers or current GI ulcers. Some adverse drug-disease interactions, like the example here, are described in formal drug warnings and contraindications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We notice that unintended drug-disease interactions occur in more contexts than off-label drug use. They can also occur when the drug is used following its label-indication and in [the context of comorbidity / multimorbidity](https://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h949), when a person is taking a drug to treat one of their diseases and the drug affects a comorbid condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**We therefore decided to reframe this question and find potential unintended drug-disease interactions with the following type of question:**\n",
    "> What symptoms do `Disease` X and `ChemicalSubstance` Y have in common? \n",
    "\n",
    "BioThings Explorer (BTE) can answer two classes of queries -- \"EXPLAIN\" and \"PREDICT\". This Question fits the EXPLAIN  template of starting with **a specific biomedical entity** (a specific `Disease` X) and finding indirect relationships with **another specific biomedical entity** (a specific `ChemicalSubstance` Y)."

    "We will use **inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)** as our specific disease of interest. We will use **Imuran** as our drug of interest. [Imuran / azathioprine](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azathioprine-drug-information) has been [commonly used **off-label** to treat Crohn disease (a form of IBD)](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309). \n",
    "  \n",
    "However, the use of Imuran to treat IBD has been linked to hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) and other lymphomas (references [1](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20888436/), [2](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21830262/), [3](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23891975/) and [4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3710465/)). In particular, [hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive, and usually fatal disease](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29337025/). This serious adverse effect is made clear in the black box warning for [Imuran](https://www.drugs.com/pro/imuran.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "We tackle the search for side-effects associated with using Imuran to treat IBD using the query: \n",
    "* `Disease` Crohn disease  &rarr; results:`Disease` &larr; `ChemicalSubstance` Imuran. \n",
    "    * Note that we use `Disease` as the intermediate node type to represent disease symptoms and drug effects. With the current APIs available and issues around BioThings type annotation (PhenotypicFeatures vs Diseases), it made more sense to use Disease as the intermediate node. \n",
    "* The query will return a graph object with entities as nodes and relationships as edges. We then use edge provenance information to **filter** the results. For each intermediate Disease node, we use the number of unique paths from the input nodes to that node to **score** it. The scores can then be used to sort the results.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Note 1: This example was inspired by the [information shared by Jeff McKnight], [a molecular biology researcher](http://molbio.uoregon.edu/mcknight/) who is currently fighting hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma after 16 years of taking Imuran and Remicade to treat Crohn disease. To help, he has a [fundraiser here](https://www.gofundme.com/f/mcknight-fund-help-jeff-buy-time-with-his-family). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note 2: many of those with IBD, this drug treatment, and this cancer are [men < 40 years old](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3710465/). Jeff may be in this age group. "
